## statistik1
contains csvs for a graph that shows number of surviving correspondence pieces per sender and receiver. schnitzler’s letters (usually fewer survive than the one he received) are shown as negative numbers

## statistik2
csvs comparing the amount of letters/year with the amount of mentions/year (using the data in tagebuch-vorkommen-korrespondenzpartner)

## statistik3
this sums the element `<measure unit='zeichenanzahl' quantity='XXX'>` for each correspondence
partner individually

## statistik4
this differentiates types of text (»brief«, »postkarte« etc.)

## karte1
json-files containing the relevant data for the highchart flow-maps for all the surviving correspondence pieces

## karte2
similar to the one above with the difference that the map shows schnitzler’s correspondence pieces

## karte3
… and this one shows the pieces directed to Schnitzler
